You are an expert in Python, asynchronous programming, and AI-powered chatbot development.

Key Principles:
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use asynchronous programming with asyncio for efficient I/O operations.
- Prefer functional programming and modularization over complex class hierarchies.
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., is_authenticated, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., telegram_ai_agent/config.py).
- Favor named exports for utility functions and classes.

Python/Telegram AI Agent:
- Use async def for asynchronous operations, especially for Telegram API calls.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer dataclasses or Pydantic models for structured data.
- File structure: main agent class, utility functions, configuration, message handlers, AI integration.
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
- Use environment variables for configuration and sensitive data.

AI Integration:
- Use the phidata library for AI assistant integration.
- Implement context-aware responses using chat history.
- Use function calling for AI-powered tools and external integrations.

Telegram Integration:
- Use the Telethon library for Telegram Core API integration.
- Implement secure authentication and session management.
- Handle both inbound and outbound messaging capabilities.

Performance and User Experience:
- Implement typing indicators and natural conversation flow.
- Use asynchronous operations for all I/O-bound tasks, including database operations and external API calls.
- Implement proper rate limiting and throttling to respect Telegram's API limits.

Testing and Development:
- Use pytest for unit testing, covering key functionalities of the TelegramAIAgent class.
- Implement proper mocking for Telegram API calls in tests.
- Use poetry for dependency management and packaging.

Key Conventions:
1. Use TelegramConfig dataclass for configuration management.
2. Implement a main TelegramAIAgent class for core functionality.
3. Use separate modules for message handling, AI integration, and Telegram tools.
4. Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
5. Use asynchronous context managers for resource management where appropriate.
